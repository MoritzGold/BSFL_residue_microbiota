# BSFL_residue_microbiota
Data and analyses for the manuscript "Identification of high-abundant bacteria in black soldier fly larvae rearing residues"

# counts.R
code on TVC, LAB and fungi counts in the substrate, residue and larvae

### data = counts.xlsx

**day**: measurment day. 0, 3, 6, 9 or 12. 0 marks the beginning of the feeding experiment, 12 the end of the feeding experiment.  
**biowaste**: C=canteen waste, S=sterile canteen waste, H=household waste  
**type**:larva, residue or no_larvae (control without larvae)  
**replicate**: replicate per treatment (combination of day, biowaste, type)  
**parameter**: describes the microbial number parameter, either TVC, LAB (=lab) or fungi (=fy) counts  
**value:** TVC, LAB and fungi count
